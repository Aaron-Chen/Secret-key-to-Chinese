A Bitcoin private key is essentially a secret 256-bit number that controls access to your funds. In its raw form, it’s just a long string of bits — impossible for humans to memorize. BIP39 was designed to solve this problem by turning long binary data into a set of human-readable words. To create a mnemonic from a private key, the first step is to treat the 32-byte private key as “entropy,” which is just the random data that will become your mnemonic. BIP39 adds an extra layer of safety by computing a checksum: it hashes the 256-bit entropy using SHA256 and takes the first 8 bits of that hash. This checksum is appended to the original 256 bits, giving a 264-bit string that is now safe to encode into words because any typo or mistake in the mnemonic can later be detected using the checksum.

The 264-bit string is then divided into 24 chunks of 11 bits each. Why 11 bits? Because the BIP39 wordlist contains 2048 words, and 11 bits can represent numbers from 0 to 2047 — exactly the size of the list. Each 11-bit chunk is converted to a number, which is then used as an index into the wordlist to select a word. The 24 words are arranged in order, creating a mnemonic that fully encodes the original private key. Later, to recover the key, you reverse the process: convert words back to indices, reconstruct the 264-bit binary string, remove the 8-bit checksum, and you’re left with the original 256-bit private key. This makes the mnemonic fully reversible and safe to use as a human-friendly representation of a secret key.
